# Dinkel_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Repo for my final project for CSCI 2270: Data Structures


Project Summary:
	This project is an expansion on Assignment9 that dealt with using
	a hashtable to store movie information. This expansion will be a
	tool to help users keep track of their favorite movies. As such,
	it will prompt users to input a ranking, 1-100 for each movie they
	store. The program will then give the options of printing the movies
	in order of rank, or in alphabetical order. This implementation will
	be done by storing the movies in a binary search tree.

	The expansion will also add additional functionality to the search
	function. The user input should not have to directly match the name
	of a movie, but should just be similar enough so that the program
	can find a reasonable match. For example: 'Interstelar' should be
	similar enough to still return 'Interstellar.'


How to Run
	Download all files and store in the same directory.
	Use the linux command: g++ FinalProject.cpp s


Dependencies
	None


System Requirements
	This program is written specifically to be run on Linux, but should
	work on any operating system with a command line compiler.
