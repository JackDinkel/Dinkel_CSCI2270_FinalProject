# Dinkel_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Repo for my final project for CSCI 2270: Data Structures


Project Summary:
	This project is an expansion on Assignment9 that dealt with using
	a hashtable to store movie information. This expansion will be a
	tool to help users keep track of their favorite movies. As such,
	it will prompt users to input a ranking, 1-100 for each movie they
	store. The program will then give the options of printing the movies

	be done by storing the movies in a binary search tree.
